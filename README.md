Whether you're an IC, manager, or director everyone plays a role in running a successful data team. But it can feel overwhelming learning all the skills required to keep a data team on track.

You can try to learn everything on the fly and by yourself but the more you can learn from others whether it be mentors, videos, books, articles, etc.

But there is still likely one problem.

### 🤔 Where To Start?

One of the problems we face in the world today isn't a lack of information but too much information. So below I put together a list of books, articles, and videos that you should read or watch.

Now, there are still a lot of articles and pieces of content here. But I view this as more of the page of resources that you can return to when you have specific problems. Thus, I have broken this resource list down by problems vs by type of resources.

Below the content is a mix of books, articles and videos and I wanted to give a legend to notify the reader which was which. The emojis listed below are said legend.

### New Manager - Making The Switch From IC

When you're making the switch from IC to manager there are so many new challenges you'll need to take on. That's why this section contains mostly books because I believe there is a lot to cover and most of it can't just be covered in a 1500 word article.

### Culture

I ended splitting culture and team organization and management(the section below) because they did feel different in terms of how they can impact your team. One is how the team is generally organized and the other is how the team feels and is driven.

-   📝 [Inside Stripe's Engineering Culture - Part 1 (paid)](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stripe) [Gergely Orosz](https://open.substack.com/users/30107029-gergely-orosz?utm_source=mentions)

### Onboarding

When you do hire someone or when you start a new role its great to have a smooth onboarding process as well as a plan for your first 90 days. That's why I picked the articles below that both review onboarding as well provide content for the employee who is just starting.

### Communication

It goes without saying that communication is a very valuable skill in any role. Even if you're the most technical person, if you can't communicate the goal of your work or help get other people on board your project will likely move slower or perhaps never even get started.

### Influence

There are several great writers on Substack that focus heavily on influence. The reason is whether you're an IC or a manager the ability to get buy-in from other teams or work with them to ensure that your project goes the right way is crucial. It can be the difference between your project and team moving forward or continuing to be stuck for the next 6 months.
